# Post Exploitation and Privilege Escalation:

At this stage trying to execute a command using the sudo keyword gives us the following:

The "no tty present on askpass program specified" message indicates we are not an user with sudo privileges.

In order to do an upgrade of our shell we need to resort to a python library called 'pty', which spawns a tty shell for us.

https://netsec.ws/?p=337 - the following link gives quite a few options to spawn a tty shell using different scripting languages.

After executing the python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")' command we now see a different output when we execute sudo -l in our terminal.

The first stage of 'upgrading' our terminal in now complete.
