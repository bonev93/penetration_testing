# WebAttacks:

## SQL Union - https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks/lab-determine-number-of-columns
In this step we repeat what we did during the lecture(in the DVWA machine we used '+union+select+null,,,, with as many nulls needed to figure out columns count)

<img width="1363" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-25 at 1 26 58" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18306338/150882925-97bbcdce-f435-4368-a28d-05f93324784f.png">

Another option would be to use ' order by [1,2,3,4...] -- in burp repeater to figure out columns count (' order by [1,2,3,4...] needs to be selected in repeater and ctrl+U needs to be executed against selection to format it properly).

## SQL Union from other tables - https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks/lab-retrieve-data-from-other-tables
Given that we know from the task description the presence of username and password in the users table the following sql attack can be implemented:

Here is the attack result. (Screenshot is from burp repeater as I intercept it and it is easier for me to work there, hope that's enough)

## SQL Login bypass - https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/lab-login-bypass
We need to access the ligin screen, execute a login attemp with random values and intercept that request.

Now we need to use administrator as an username param in the request. Here is the request:

Here is the final result:

## SQL Hidden data - https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/lab-retrieve-hidden-data
 This attack can be executed by appending a condition to the sql query returning a large set of values:
 category='+WHERE+TRUE+--+
 category='+OR+1=1+--+

Here are modified requests. I find the ctrl+U command in burp quite handy for those.

## Time based SQL injection - https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/blind/lab-time-delays

On this one there are a few ways to proceed. (select sleep(x)) or ' || pg_sleep(x); // couldn't add prove screenshot here.
example modification:

## Simple OS Command injection - https://portswigger.net/web-security/os-command-injection/lab-simple

This task gets easily solved by appending |whoami to the POST request for /product/stock endpoint.

## Time delay OS Command Injection - https://portswigger.net/web-security/os-command-injection/lab-blind-time-delays
A ping to localhost is appended here in the email section:

## Reflected XSS - https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/reflected/lab-html-context-nothing-encoded

The easiest example here is with a simple alert(). Also we could print something in the console.

## Stored XSS - https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/stored/lab-html-context-nothing-encoded

An alert is used here to check if Kole has finally received whatever he's been waiting for.

## DOM based XSS - https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/dom-based/lab-document-write-sink

This one requires an injection in the src of the img tag in the html.

Here is final result

## Test SQL injection, XSS, OS Command injection and File upload against DVWA low security

### SQL Injection
First step is to set machine security to low(a good amount of time was spent on my side here, "try harder" motto seems to be accurate)

then execute the following in the submit field

![Screen Shot 2022-01-25 at 20 44 44](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18306338/151039410-13748e6f-cbc4-446f-a1e2-e65bbf0cd021.png)

we get the following error which shows us we are looking for too many columns.

## XSS example

As with the demo in portswigger an alert here is the usual example.

## OS Command injection

After adding 127.0.0.1|whoami in the search box we get the output 'nobody'

## File upload against DVWA low security
