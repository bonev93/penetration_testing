# WebAttacks:

## SQL Union - https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks/lab-determine-number-of-columns
In this step we repeat what we did during the lecture(in the DVWA machine we used '+union+select+null,,,, with as many nulls needed to figure out columns count)

Another option would be to use ' order by [1,2,3,4...] -- in burp repeater to figure out columns count (' order by [1,2,3,4...] needs to be selected in repeater and ctrl+U needs to be executed against selection to format it properly).

## SQL Union from other tables - https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks/lab-retrieve-data-from-other-tables
Given that we know from the task description the presence of username and password in the users table the following sql attack can be implemented:

Here is the attack result. (Screenshot is from burp repeater as I intercept it and it is easier for me to work there, hope that's enough)
